##Unlimited party mod for Fallout 2

Version 3

This mod removes dialogue charisma checks on party join in Fallout 2.


###Special notes:
- **It will ONLY work if you have killap's patch** or restoration pack (or both) installed. You can get those at http://www.killap.net.
- It does not remove other checks (karma, etc). Companions may still refuse to join because of that.
- It should be **compatible with any other mod** provided that "unlimited party" is installed last. It patches files instead of overwriting them.
- It affects the following companions:
    * Brain bot
    * Cassidy
    * Cat Jules
    * Davin
    * Dex
    * Dogmeat
    * Goris
    * Kitsune
    * K-9
    * Lenny
    * Marcus
    * Miria
    * Miron
    * Robodog
    * Sulik
    * Vic
- Start a new game after installation.

##Unlimited party mod for Fallout 2

Version 2

This mod removes dialogue charisma checks on party join in Fallout 2.


###Special notes:
- **It will ONLY work if you have killap's patch** or restoration pack (or both) installed. You can get those at http://www.killap.net.
- It does not remove other checks (karma, etc). Companions may still refuse to join because of that.
- It affects the following companions:
** Brain bot
** Cassidy
** Cat Jules
** Davin
** Dex
** Dogmeat
** Goris
** Kitsune
** K-9
** Lenny
** Marcus
** Miria
** Miron
** Robodog
** Sulik
** Vic
- It should be compatible with *any* other mod provided that unlimited party is installed last. It patches files instead of overwriting them.
- Start a new game after installation
- If you have any issues, reach me on github. Attach logs (fallout2-unlimited-party-mod/tools/logs) so I could debug.

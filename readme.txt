Unlimited party mod for Fallout 2
Version 2

This mod removes charisma party checks.

Note the following:
- It will ONLY work if you have killap's patch or restoration pack (or both) installed
- It does not remove other checks (karma, etc). Companions may still refuse to join because of that.
- It only affects joinable persistent companions, namely: Vic, Dogmeat, Lenny, Marcus, Sulik, Miron, Goris, Cassidy, Robodog, Brain bot. Others should join you anyway.
- It should be compatible with *any( other mod provided that unlimited party is installed last. It patches files instead of overwriting them.
- Start a new game after installation
